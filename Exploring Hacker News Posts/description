# Hacker News User Engagement Analysis Project

Conducted a comprehensive data analysis project on Hacker News to understand user engagement dynamics. Explored the following aspects:

- Investigated comment patterns between 'Ask HN' and 'Show HN' posts to determine the category receiving more comments on average.
- Delved into the impact of post creation times on comment rates, unveiling insights into the optimal timing for fostering community engagement.

This project showcased my analytical skills and ability to draw meaningful conclusions from data, providing valuable insights for content strategy on the Hacker News platform.
